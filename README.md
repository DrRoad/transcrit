Transport Network Criticality Analysis

This github is a documentation of a master thesis entitled:
Measuring Freight Transport Network Criticality: A Case Study in Bangladesh

Still under construction....

## Index

### criticality_results
The results of the eighteen criticality metrics for Bangladesh's multimodal freight transport network are stored in this folder.

### model_input_data
The raw input data for the model is stored in this folder. The raw data consists of shapefiles of Bangladesh's transport network and the socioeconomic profiles of districts in Bangladesh.

### transport_network_modeling
This folder contains Python codes of the transport network criticality library developed in this study. 

### 01_example_metric_calculation.ipynb
This workbook provides several examples of the use of the transport_network_modeling library.

### 02_geovisualization.ipynb
This workbook provides example of interactive geovisualization to display the transport model results.

### 03_criticality_result_analysis.ipynb
This workbook provides ex-post analyses conducted from the transport network criticality study (related to the content of the thesis book).

### 04_illustrative_case_study.ipynb
This workbook provides two illustrative case studies of Bangladesh's freight transport network criticality (related to the content of the thesis book).
